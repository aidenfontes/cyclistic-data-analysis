## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**  
This project analyzes **2021 Divvy bike share trip data** to uncover **how annual members and casual riders use the service differently**.  
The goal: **Provide actionable recommendations** to increase memberships and optimize bike allocation.  

**Framework used:** Google Data Analytics 6-step process  
> **Ask â†’ Prepare â†’ Process â†’ Analyze â†’ Share â†’ Act**

## **ðŸŽ¯ Business Task**  
**Key Question:**  
> *How do annual members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?*  

**Objective:**  
- Identify **behavioral differences** between user groups.  
- Develop **data-driven recommendations** to:  
  - Increase casual-to-member conversions.  
  - Improve bike availability across stations and times.  

**Stakeholders:**  
- Divvy Marketing Team.  
- Divvy Operations Team.

## **ðŸ“‚ Dataset**  
- **Source:** [Divvy System Data](https://divvybikes.com/system-data) (Janâ€“Dec 2021).  
- **Files:** 12 monthly CSVs combined into one dataset (~5.5M rows).  
- **Key columns:**  
  - `ride_id` â€“ Unique trip identifier.  
  - `rideable_type` â€“ Type of bike (classic, docked, e-bike).  
  - `started_at`, `ended_at` â€“ Trip timestamps.  
  - `start_station_name`, `end_station_name`.  
  - `member_casual` â€“ User type: *member* or *casual*.  

---

## **ðŸ›  Process**  
### 1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**  
- Combined 12 monthly datasets into a single DataFrame.  
- Converted timestamps to datetime.  
- Removed missing & invalid entries (null stations, negative/zero durations).  
- Created new features:  
  - **Ride duration (minutes)**.  
  - **Day of week**, **month**, **hour of day**.  

### 2. **Exploratory Analysis:**  
- Ride counts by **user type**, **day**, **month**, **hour**, and **bike type**.  
- **Top stations** for members vs casual riders.  
- **Seasonality** trends across the year.  

### 3. **Visualization:**  
- Created bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps using **Seaborn** & **Matplotlib**.

## **ðŸ”‘ Key Insights & Actions**  

### 1. **Members ride mostly on weekdays during commute hours.**  
> **Action:** Launch **weekday commuter loyalty programs** & ensure **bike availability at business districts during 7â€“9 AM & 5â€“7 PM**.  

### 2. **Casual riders peak on weekends and take longer rides.**  
> **Action:** Create **weekend/day pass packages** & offer **discounts for long-duration rides** to target leisure users and tourists.  

### 3. **Casual riders favor e-bikes; members prefer classic bikes.**  
> **Action:** **Redistribute e-bikes** to tourist stations & **stock classic bikes** near workplaces.  

### 4. **Seasonal spikes in summer usage (Juneâ€“Sept).**  
> **Action:** **Increase fleet size & maintenance capacity** in peak months. Offer **winter promotions** to encourage off-season ridership.  

### 5. **Top stations differ significantly between members & casuals.**  
> **Action:** **Prioritize rebalancing & maintenance** at busiest stations. Deploy **QR-code marketing campaigns** at tourist-heavy stations.
